To-do list:
* Figure out how to pass complex data structures through form params (e.g., {bill: [{name: 'Steak', value: '10.00'}, {name: 'Falafel', value: '5.95'}]} )
* Move html to a separate template file
* Return results in the http response body rather than writing to $stdout
* Add ability to append more items and map those to diner names
* Put it up on the internets
